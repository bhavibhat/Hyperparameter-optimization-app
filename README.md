This project is a web application built with Streamlit and Python for hyperparameter optimization. 
It provides a user-friendly interface to explore different machine learning models and optimize their hyperparameters efficiently.

Features

- Select from a variety of machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM).
- Customize hyperparameters for each selected model.
- Choose optimization algorithms (e.g., Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization).
- Visualize the optimization process with interactive plots.
- Compare the performance of different hyperparameter configurations.
- Export optimized model for further use.

Technologies Used

- Streamlit: For building the web application.
- Python: For backend logic and machine learning algorithms.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and hyperparameter optimization.
- Plotly: For interactive visualization of optimization results.
- Other Python libraries as necessary.
